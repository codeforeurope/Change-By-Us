              and/or Google+ by heading to the upper left-hand corner.

            <h3>How do I write a mission statement?</h3>
            <p>A good mission statement should accurately explain a problem you and 
              your team hope to address and how you plan to accomplish your goal in 
              the future. It should articulate the project&#39;s essential nature, its
              values and its work.</p>
              <br>
            <p>Your mission should answer these three key questions:
              <br>
              <br>What are the opportunities or needs that exist that your 
                project will address?  Example: &quot;There is trash on the street.&quot;
              <br>What will you be doing to address those needs? Example: &quot;Let&#39;s
                get together and clean the street up.&quot;
              <br>What values, principles, or beliefs guide your work? 
                Example: &quot;We all want a clean, safe neighborhood.&quot;
            </p>

Code for America began working with CEOs for Cities to bring Change by Us to Philadelphia  and Seattle in the fall of 2011, bringing engineering resources and open-source expertise to the project. Making Change by Us open source will allow the project to be implemented affordably and efficiently in more cities across the country.</p>
